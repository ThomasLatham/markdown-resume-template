# markdown-resume

A resume template in Markdown and styled with CSS.

The template started with Teng-Jui Lin's
[markdown-resume](https://github.com/tengjuilin/markdown-resume) and has been modified to reflect
Terrence Kuo's [killer Software Engineering
résumé](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-a-killer-software-engineering-resume-b11c91ef699d/).
I exported the Markdown file to PDF using  [Markdown PDF
Plus](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tom-latham.markdown-pdf-plus).

I've now also added templates for a cover letter and references page in the same style as the
resume.
